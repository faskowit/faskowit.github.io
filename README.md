## Hello! 

I'm a postdoc at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/), working with the [Brain Networks & Behavior Lab](https://www.brainnetworkslab.com/) (aka [BetzelLab](https://twitter.com/networks_lab)) and the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.indiana.edu/~cortex/) (aka [SpornsLab](https://twitter.com/spornslab)). I'm part of a research community that examines brain architecture through the lens of network science (+'graph theory') and its applications. In other words, we attempt to comprehend the complexities of that oxygen-hungry jello-like blob sloshing around in our csf-swimming pool (a.k.a skull) by conceptualizing it as a network of finely wired neurological components. An advantage of our network neuroscience approach is that we can attempt to clarify "complex organization" with intuitive algorithms and operations. Through our work, we search for ways in which the brain might be organized into non-trivial anatomical communities or could be analyzed across time with certain correlational properties. My grad work was supported by an NSF GRFP, the IU graduate school, and my department. I'm personally supported by wonderful colleagues/friends in the [department of psychologcial and brain sciences](https://psych.indiana.edu/) and in the greater [neuro community](https://www.sfn.org/) [around the world](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3267&pageid=1). Check out [my Github](https://github.com/faskowit) for scripts, code, and data related to these endeavors ([projects](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-31202-1) on community detection in brain networks [here](https://github.com/faskowit/Faskowitz2018wsbmLifeSpan) and [here](https://github.com/faskowit/Faskowitz2019wsbmRatBrain)! Also, some edgy tools [here](https://github.com/brain-networks/edge-centric_demo) and [here](https://github.com/faskowit/overlap_on_NxN_func) and [here](https://github.com/brain-networks/edge-ts)). I've also been compiling a list of [openly-available brain network data](https://github.com/faskowit/brain-networks-across-the-web), for all of us to enjoy. 

I completed my Ph.D. in 2021 under the supervision of Olaf Sporns at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/). I studied neuro- and cog- science (and minored in marketing...go figure) at the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/) (2014), and helped out in the [Emotion and Cognition Lab](http://gero.usc.edu/labs/matherlab/). Following undergrad, I made the trek westward on the I-10 to Marina del Rey, where I worked as a research assistant at the USC [Imaging Genetics Center](http://igc.ini.usc.edu/). Here I assisted on a wide range of mri projects (including [Enigma](http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/)), and picked up sage guidance and advice. 

I hail from Orange County, CA. It's a nice place with a very enjoyable shoreline. I'm an admirer of [modern architecture](http://www.getty.edu/visit/center/architecture.html), [vectorfunk](http://www.mwmgraphics.com/vectorfunk.html), music videos (esp. from the [hommies](https://www.instagram.com/psychofilms/) back in LA), and Google Earth. Additionally, I am very fond of coffee, cheese, spy novels, [prog-rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selling_England_by_the_Pound), trivial [sports statistics](https://fivethirtyeight.com/sports/), grillin' burgers, [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/), [buying books](http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/tsundoku-should-enter-the-english-language.html), pub trivia, Insta filters, [atlas obscura](http://www.atlasobscura.com/), and sour [beer](http://blog.mikkeller.dk/).
