## Hello! 

I'm a 5th-year neuroscience and psychology graduate student at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/) and a member of the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.indiana.edu/~cortex/) (aka [SpornsLab](https://twitter.com/spornslab)). I'm part of a research group that examines brain architecture through the lens of network science ('graph theory') and its applications. In other words, we attempt to comprehend the complexities of that oxygen-hungry jello-like blob sloshing around in our csf-swimming pool (a.k.a skull) ... by conceptualizing it as a network of finely wired neurological components. Through this work, we search for ways in which the brain might be organized into non-trivial anatomical communities or could be analyzed across time with certain correlational properties. My grad work is supported by an NSF GRFP. I'm supported by wonderful colleagues/friends in the [department of psychologcial and brain sciences](https://psych.indiana.edu/) and in the greater [neuro community](https://www.sfn.org/) [around the world](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3267&pageid=1). Check out [my Github](https://github.com/faskowit) for scripts, code, and data related to these endeavors ([first-year project](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-31202-1) on community detection in brain networks [here](https://github.com/faskowit/Faskowitz2018wsbmLifeSpan) and [here](https://github.com/faskowit/Faskowitz2019wsbmRatBrain)!). 

I studied neuro- and cog- science at the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/) (2014), and helped out in the [Emotion and Cognition Lab](http://gero.usc.edu/labs/matherlab/). Upon graduation, I made the trek westward on the I-10 to Marina del Rey, where I worked as a research assistant at the USC [Imaging Genetics Center](http://igc.ini.usc.edu/). Here I assisted on a wide range of mri projects (including [Enigma](http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/)), and picked up sage guidance and advice. 

I hail from Orange County, CA. It's a nice place with a very enjoyable shoreline. I'm an admirer of [modern architecture](http://www.getty.edu/visit/center/architecture.html), [vectorfunk](http://www.mwmgraphics.com/vectorfunk.html), music videos (esp. from the [hommies](https://www.instagram.com/psychofilms/) back in LA), and Google Earth. Additionally, I am very fond of coffee, cheese, spy novels, newspapers, [prog-rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selling_England_by_the_Pound), trivial [sports statistics](https://fivethirtyeight.com/sports/), grillin' burgers, [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/), actual statistics, [buying books](http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/tsundoku-should-enter-the-english-language.html), pub trivia, [atlas obscura](http://www.atlasobscura.com/), and sour [beer](http://blog.mikkeller.dk/).
