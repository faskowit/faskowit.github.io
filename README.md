## Hello! 

I'm a second-year neurosceince and psycholoy graduate student at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/); member of the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.indiana.edu/~cortex/) (aka [SpornsLab](https://twitter.com/spornslab)). I think brains are super cool, and I enjoy studying these silly sponges from a variety of perspectives. My research is a stew of brains, networks/network science, mri, data-preprocessing, data-postprocessing, and modeling. Check back here for scripts, code, and data that I plan to post (first-year project on community detection in brain networks coming soon!). 

I studied neuro- and cog- science at the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/) (2014), and helped out in the [Emotion and Cognition Lab](http://www.usc.edu/projects/matherlab). Upon graduation, I made the trek westward on the I-10 to Marina del Rey, where I worked as a research assistant at the USC [Imaging Genetics Center](http://igc.ini.usc.edu/). Here I assisted on a wide range of mri projects (including [Enigma](http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/)), and picked up sage guidance and advice. 

I hail from Orange County, CA. It's a nice place with a very enjoyable shoreline. I'm an admirer of [modern architecture](http://www.getty.edu/visit/center/architecture.html) and [vectorfunk](http://www.mwmgraphics.com/vectorfunk.html). Additionally, I am very fond of coffee, spy novels, trivial sports statistics, actual statistics, [atlas obscura](http://www.atlasobscura.com/), and floral/sour hipster beer.
