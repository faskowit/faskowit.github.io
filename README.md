## Hello! 

I'm a first-year neurosceince and psycholoy graduate student at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/); member of the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.indiana.edu/~cortex/) (aka [SpornsLab](https://twitter.com/spornslab)). I think brains are super cool, and I enjoy studying these silly sponges from a variety of perspectives. My research is a stew of brains, networks, mri, eeg (I'm learning!), preprocessing, postprocessing, and models. Additionally, I am very fond of coffee. 

I studied neuro and cog science at the University of Southern California (2014), and helped out in the [Emotion and Cognition Lab](http://www.usc.edu/projects/matherlab/people.html). Upon graduation, I make the trek across Los Angeles to the Marina del Rey, where I worked as a research assistant at the [Imaging Genetics Center](http://igc.ini.usc.edu/). Here I assisted on a wide range of mri projects, and picked up sage guidance and advice.
