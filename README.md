## Hello! 

I'm a third-year neuroscience and psychology graduate student at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/) and a member of the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.indiana.edu/~cortex/) (aka [SpornsLab](https://twitter.com/spornslab)). I think brains are super cool, and I enjoy studying these silly sponges from a variety of perspectives. My research is a stew of brains, networks, mri, pre-processing, post-processing, and modeling. My focus is to examine brain architecture through the lens of network science and its applications. Check out [my Github](https://github.com/faskowit) for scripts, code, and data ([first-year project](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-31202-1) on community detection in brain networks [here](https://github.com/faskowit/Faskowitz2018wsbmLifeSpan)!). 

I studied neuro- and cog- science at the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/) (2014), and helped out in the [Emotion and Cognition Lab](http://gero.usc.edu/labs/matherlab/). Upon graduation, I made the trek westward on the I-10 to Marina del Rey, where I worked as a research assistant at the USC [Imaging Genetics Center](http://igc.ini.usc.edu/). Here I assisted on a wide range of mri projects (including [Enigma](http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/)), and picked up sage guidance and advice. 

I hail from Orange County, CA. It's a nice place with a very enjoyable shoreline. I'm an admirer of [modern architecture](http://www.getty.edu/visit/center/architecture.html), [vectorfunk](http://www.mwmgraphics.com/vectorfunk.html), music videos (esp. from the [hommies](https://www.instagram.com/psychofilms/) back in LA), and Google Earth. Additionally, I am very fond of coffee, cheese, spy novels, newspapers, [prog-rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selling_England_by_the_Pound), trivial [sports statistics](https://fivethirtyeight.com/sports/), grillin' burgers, [Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/), actual statistics, [buying books](http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/tsundoku-should-enter-the-english-language.html), pub trivia, [atlas obscura](http://www.atlasobscura.com/), and sour [beer](http://blog.mikkeller.dk/).
